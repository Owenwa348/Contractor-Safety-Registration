# BookTraining Module - Refactored Structure

## Overview
The BookTraining module has been refactored from a monolithic single file into a modular, component-based architecture that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Directory Structure

## Components

### 1. TrainingInfo.vue
**Purpose**: Displays detailed information about the selected training event.

**Props**:
- `selectedEvent` (Object): The training event data
- `round` (String): Training round information
- `examDateDisplay` (String): Formatted exam date
- `eventType` (String): Type of training event
- `formatDate` (Function): Date formatting function

### 2. SearchAndControls.vue
**Purpose**: Provides search functionality and bulk action buttons.

**Props**:
- `search` (String): Search term with v-model support
- `selectedCount` (Number): Number of selected people
- `selectedEvent` (Object): Currently selected training event

**Events**:
- `update:search`: Search term updates
- `book-selected`: Book selected people
- `select-all-people`: Select all people
- `select-only-approved`: Select only approved people
- `select-only-not-passed`: Select only non-approved people
- `clear-selection`: Clear all selections

### 3. StatusStatistics.vue
**Purpose**: Shows statistics for approved and not passed people.

**Props**:
- `approvedCount` (Number): Count of approved people
- `notPassedCount` (Number): Count of not passed people

### 4. PersonTable.vue
**Purpose**: Reusable table component for displaying people lists.

**Props**:
- `people` (Array): Array of people to display
- `title` (String): Table title
- `allSelected` (Boolean): Whether all people are selected
- `variant` (String): 'approved' or 'not_passed' for styling
- `emptyMessage` (String): Message when no people
- `showFailedTraining` (Boolean): Show failed training column

**Events**:
- `select-all`: Toggle all selections
- `toggle-selection`: Toggle individual selection
- `remove-person`: Remove a person

### 5. NoTrainingSelected.vue
**Purpose**: Empty state component when no training is selected.

**Events**:
- `go-to-calendar`: Navigate to training calendar

## Composables

### useTrainingBooking.js
**Purpose**: Manages training booking related state and operations.

**Returns**:
- State: `selectedEvent`, `examDateDisplay`, `round`, `eventType`, etc.
- Methods: `formatDate`, `bookSelected`, `showNotification`

### usePersonManagement.js
**Purpose**: Handles person selection and management operations.

**Returns**:
- State: `people`, `search`, `selectedPeople`, `approvedPeople`, `notPassedPeople`
- Computed: `selectedCount`, `allApprovedSelected`, `allNotPassedSelected`
- Methods: Selection operations, filtering, person removal

## Key Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Changes to one feature don't affect others
- Easier to locate and fix bugs

### 2. **Better Reusability**
- PersonTable component can be reused for different types of lists
- Composables can be shared across other components
- Modular design allows for easy extension

### 3. **Enhanced Readability**
- Main component is much cleaner and easier to understand
- Each component is focused on specific functionality
- Clear separation between UI and business logic

### 4. **Easier Testing**
- Individual components can be tested in isolation
- Business logic in composables can be unit tested
- Mocking dependencies is simpler

### 5. **Better Developer Experience**
- Smaller files are easier to navigate
- Clear component boundaries
- Type safety with props and emits

## Usage Example

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Clean, declarative template using components -->
    <TrainingInfo :selected-event="selectedEvent" />
    <PersonTable 
      :people="approvedPeople"
      variant="approved"
      @toggle-selection="handleSelection"
    />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
// Clean, focused logic using composables
const { selectedEvent } = useTrainingBooking()
const { approvedPeople, togglePersonSelection } = usePersonManagement()

const handleSelection = (personId) => {
  togglePersonSelection(personId)
}
</script>
```

## Migration Notes

### Before (Monolithic)
- Single file with 650+ lines
- Mixed concerns in one component
- Difficult to understand and maintain
- Hard to test individual features

### After (Modular)
- Main component reduced to ~80 lines
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand each part
- Individual components can be tested

## Future Improvements

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Test each component and composable individually
2. **TypeScript**: Add type definitions for better development experience
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries
4. **Performance**: Add lazy loading for large lists
5. **Accessibility**: Improve ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
